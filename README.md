 Project 3 - Interactive Form

 In this project, I used jQuery to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional
 conference called "Full Stack Conf".

 First, the initial set up is done by hiding, showing and creating some elements to be used
 when the page is functioning with javascript.

 In this project, my goal is to get the "Exceeds Expectations" grade.
 To reach this goal, besides building the basic workings of the form, I aimed
 on solving these 3 extra topics:

1. T Shirt Section: "Hide the color label and select menu until a T-shirt design is selected from the Desing menu"
    - This topic is done on inside the #design input event handler. 
        - More specific, on the else block.

2. Conditional Error Message
    - The #cc-num input and click event handler displays a real time alert
        - if the credit card number is empty the message displayed will be 'Please, enter a credit card number'
        - if the credit card number doesn't containg between 13 and 16 digits, the message displayed will be 
        'Please, enter a number between 13 and 16 digits long'.
    - When the button is submitted, if the name field is empty, it will display a particular message telling the
    user to Enter at least one character.

3. Real-time Error messages
    - Already worked on it as mentioned on the previous topic, showing a message in real time to the user
    when they're filling the credit card number field.


The code definetly code use some refactoring, so I'll try to improve it later. But for now, it seems to be working fine.
